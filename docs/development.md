# Development

## Supported toolchain

- Go 1.26.x
- Python 3.14.x
- uv 0.11.x
- GNU Make

Install locked Python dependencies, then run the aggregate gate:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
make check
```

`make check` runs generation reproducibility, formatting, lint, Python source
type checks, Go and Python tests, all Go command builds, and a Python import
smoke test. Generated Protobuf Python modules are excluded from the source type
check because their runtime-defined attributes do not ship static type stubs.

Focused commands:

```bash
make generate        # regenerate committed Go and Python Protobuf bindings
make generate-check  # regenerate and compare with committed bindings
make lint
make type-check
make test
make build
```

Generation uses `grpcio-tools==1.75.1` from `uv.lock` and installs
`protoc-gen-go@v1.36.10` into the ignored `.tools/bin` directory. It does not
use an unpinned system `protoc`.

Generated transport types live under `go/gen` and
`python/src/harness_agents/_generated`. Handwritten domain validation must not
be added to those directories.
